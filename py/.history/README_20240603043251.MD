# UAV Fault Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing fault data in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) flight data, primarily to understand and detect failures in UAV operations based on comparisons between actual and target data.

The program utilizes data from UAV flight logs generated in Simulink to identify and categorize types of failures (faults) based on the residuals between the expected (target) values and the actual values. This analysis is crucial for enhancing the safety and operational efficiency of UAVs.

## Concept Fault in the Program
1. Residual Calculation
   
    The residuals are calculated as the difference between the actual and target values for each parameter. This can be formally expressed as:

    ![\Large R=A-T](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;R=A-T) 

    where ùëÖ represents the residuals, ùê¥ is the matrix of actual values, and ùëá is the matrix of target values.

2. Standard Deviation and Threshold

    The program computes the standard deviation of the residuals to establish a threshold for detecting faults. This involves calculating the standard deviation for each parameter across the dataset:
    
    ![\Large \sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{xi-\mu}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{xi-\mu}}) 

    where ùúé is the standard deviation, represents individual data points, ùúá is the mean of the data, and ùëÅ is the total number of data points.

    The faults are then identified where the absolute value of the residuals exceeds a certain multiple (threshold factor) of the standard deviation:

    ![\Large \sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{xi-\mu}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;{if}|R_i|>k.\sigma) 

    where ùëò is the threshold factor (default is 2 in the program, which corresponds to a common practice of considering values beyond two standard deviations as potential outliers).

## Fault Data Representation
In our fault data analysis, we employ various data representation methods to clarify and deepen the understanding of the failures that occur. Here are the types of representations used:

1. Numeric Fault 
2. Categorical Fault 
3. Spatial Fault 
4. Multidimensional Fault

Each of these representation types offers a different perspective on failure data and can be selected based on analysis needs. For instance, numeric and categorical representations are very useful for statistical analysis and quick decision-making, whereas spatial and multidimensional representations are more suitable for in-depth analysis and visualizing complex data."
